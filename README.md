# Synaptic Sampling for a Restricted Boltzmann Machine.

Implementation of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine with Synaptic Sampling (Bayesian Inference) in Python.

Project done for the Neurosciences course of the second semester of Master MVA.
Following implementation and experiences of papers "Network Plasticity as Bayesian Inference" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.05143) and Synaptic Sampling: A Bayesian Approach to Neural Network Plasticity and Rewiring (https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5952-synaptic-sampling-a-bayesian-approach-to-neural-network-plasticity-and-rewiring.pdf) by David Kappel, Stefan Habenschuss, Robert Legenstein and Wolfgang Maass.

Several experiences available in the jupyter file, with MNIST images of MFCC of MNIST audio files. 
More details of experiences and results and analysis of the papers in the project report (in french).
